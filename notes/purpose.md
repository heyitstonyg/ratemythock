## **Why RateMyThock.com?**

Mechanical keyboards are more than just toolsâ€”they are personal expressions of style, feel, and sound. The auditory experience of a keyboard is influenced by its build, materials, switches, and mods, yet no centralized platform exists to systematically evaluate and categorize these sounds. **RateMyThock.com** fills this gap, empowering users to:

- Share and showcase their keyboard builds and sounds.
- Rate and analyze the auditory qualities of keyboards using community-agreed descriptors.
- Explore a library of sounds to identify and replicate their ideal typing experience.
